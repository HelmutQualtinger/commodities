# Commodities Project

This project is a web application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite that aims to display various commodities data. It provides a simple and efficient way to visualize and interact with commodity information.

## Technology Stack

*   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
*   **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling that provides a fast development experience.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm (usually comes with Node.js) or Yarn

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd commodities
    ```
2.  Install NPM packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Project

To run the project in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```
or
```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

### Building for Production

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```
or
```bash
yarn build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the production-ready static files.
